 * - `"slots"`: CSS-grid-like — position is a function of *index*. The
 *   pristine snapshot's measured child boxes are the slots; a simulated
 *   entry adopts the geometry of the slot at its index. Requires the
 *   main-axis track geometry to be independent of which items occupy it
 *   (fixed/fr/percent templates); see `slotLayoutPositions` for the full
