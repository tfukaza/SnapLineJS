# Start Here

This directory is the house doctrine for repos that intentionally use the full opinionated stack. Use this file as the map, not as the place where every decision is re-explained.

## Use this directory when

- the repo already uses this stack
- the repo is intentionally converging toward this stack
- the task touches framework choice, schema ownership, docs policy, dependency policy, or design-system policy

If the repo only needs portable maintainability rules, stay in [`../doctrine/`](../doctrine/).

## Core shape

- content sites use Astro
- product applications use a React SPA with TanStack Router
- backend concerns live in Cloudflare Workers
- shared contracts derive from source-of-truth schemas
- the toolchain runs through Vite+ via `vp`
