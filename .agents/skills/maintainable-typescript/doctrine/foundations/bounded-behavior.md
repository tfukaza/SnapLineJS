# Bounded Behavior

**Rule:** Every retry has a max. Every queue has a size limit. Every poll has a timeout. Every payload has a cap. Unbounded anything is a production incident waiting to happen.

## Why agents get this wrong

Agents write the happy path well. They add retry logic, polling loops, and queue processing. But they often forget to add bounds — `while (!done)` without a max iteration count, `setTimeout(poll, 1000)` without a deadline, retry logic without backoff or a ceiling.

## What to do instead

Every loop, retry, queue, buffer, or recurring operation needs an explicit bound. Define it as a constant. Make it visible.

## Checklist

- [ ] Retries have `MAX_RETRIES` with exponential backoff
- [ ] Polling has a `TIMEOUT_MS` that stops the loop
- [ ] Queues have a `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE` that applies backpressure
- [ ] Payloads have a `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` that rejects oversized input
- [ ] Batch operations have a `BATCH_SIZE` limit
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection has a max attempts before giving up
- [ ] Recursive functions have a depth limit or are rewritten as iteration

## Example

Owner constants

```typescript
export const MAX_GITHUB_FETCH_ATTEMPTS = 3;
export const INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 250;
```

Feature usage

```typescript
import { getPullRequestDiffInputSchema } from '@repo/contracts/github/get-pull-request-diff';
import {
  INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY_MS,
  MAX_GITHUB_FETCH_ATTEMPTS,
} from '@repo/github-client/github-retry-policy';
import { buildPullRequestDiffUrl } from '@/lib/github/build-pull-request-diff-url';
import { publicProcedure } from '../orpc';
import { sleep } from '@/lib/sleep';

async function fetchPullRequestDiff(url: string): Promise<Response | null> {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < MAX_GITHUB_FETCH_ATTEMPTS; attempt += 1) {
    try {
      return await fetch(url);
    } catch {
      if (attempt < MAX_GITHUB_FETCH_ATTEMPTS - 1) {
        await sleep(INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY_MS * 2 ** attempt);
      }
    }
  }

  return null;
}

export const getPullRequestDiff = publicProcedure
  .input(getPullRequestDiffInputSchema)
  .handler(async ({ input, errors }) => {
    const response = await fetchPullRequestDiff(
      buildPullRequestDiffUrl(input.pullRequestNumber),
    );

    if (!response) {
      throw errors.BAD_GATEWAY({
        data: {
          code: 'pull_request_diff_unavailable',
          message: 'Unable to load the pull request diff.',
          attempts: MAX_GITHUB_FETCH_ATTEMPTS,
          pullRequestNumber: input.pullRequestNumber,
        },
      });
    }

    return { diff: await response.text() };
  });
```

## Why this is an agent-specific problem

Humans intuit that a `while (true)` is dangerous. Agents don't have that instinct — they write structurally correct code that can run forever under the wrong conditions. Explicit bounds are the safeguard.
